        <h4>Superman 2</h4>
        <p>
          Well this one is not that good as the first superman movie. If the first one suit you please just skip some of this one. When anyone who planet is
          destroyed and is the last surviver some people may want to kill the man just to be famous than the first one and find their weakness just to kill 
          the man who want fame and fortune. Will superman be able to finish the job.

          <!--Batman-->
        <h4>Batman Vs Superman</h4>
          <p>
           It is in your face to see a mortal able to kill an imortal. So everything is still going on well with superman just like the first one, Superman
           face a new opponent and is a mortal. Who will win the mortal or the god(Superman)?.
