       <!--Dragon Ball Super Anime-->
        <h2>Dragon Ball</h2>
        <p>
         Dragon Ball is an anime that talks about a man who home planent was destroyed and is now saving planet earth (Dragon Ball Z or Zu).
         the name of the main character is <b>Goku or Kakarot</b> who answers to both of those name. Goku can literaly save your life without beign worried on unsafe
         about what will happen and wheather anything would go wrong. I like this man but there are many others who I like more than Goku.
        </p>

        <p>
        Goku can turn into diffrent forms example: so then he use his power to save earth but many tereble people came to destroy planet earth and Goku beign a buffon
        thought they will kill his love ones even though he thinking they will kill them is not that dumb but he is a very dumb dumb so he decided to save Earth and then  
        the earth. So he stood in-between them and earth so Goku began to save earth from any form of danger coming their way. So Goku met Bulma and Bulma is very high tech
        and Goku didn't mind at all living with her so he stayed.
        </p>

        <p>
          Here are some of Goku transformation. Goku transformation is turning or getting a bigger boost of power in his DNA or in his body so for him to be able to defeat his
          opponent and try as much as possible to win. So Goku gains this transformation either by getting completly mad trying to end his opponent or the villain kill, destroy,
          or harm his friends and family.
        </p>

          This is some of Goku fight that we will watch. Goku fought against many characters and won some, but some he needed help to defeat them and also some he 
          made them their friends e.g Broly. If you like these, then watch these videos. If you want to watch and finally enjoy yourself and see some transformation

        <h3>Goku vs Berus</h3>
        <p>
          This is the first time Goku fights a destroyer or a deity of a planet and Goku always want to fight all the strongest opponents so as for him to get stronger and 
          he also loves to train and all of the rest involving fighting and getting stronger. So Goku gladly accept this death wish to fight a destroyer just to see his power
          or to get stronger.

        <h3>Goku vs Jerin (Part 1-3)</h3>
        <p>
          Well Goku vs Jiren is completly unbelievable and verry cool to watch and enjoy. Especially this one I got for you and I think you will enjoy it when your watching the whole
          video here and now. If you love DBS, you better watch this and then you will love iit. It is 100/10 in my record of awesome anime fighting we are to watch. Goku was in the 
          tournament of power against universe 11, the strongest one who is Jerin and Goku want to fight him. Goku transforms into almost all of his sayians but then he transform SSJ
          Blue and the fight begins. There Goku and Jerin fight but Goku is like loosing to Jeren but then he turns into SSJ Blue <small>x</small> Kiaokan <small>x</small> 20. Goku ask
          for all of his friends energy to make a spirit bomb but Jerin deflects the spirit bomb and it hits Goku. By that time in the dying minute Goku was almost out of the tournament
          of power then he now got the ultimate power which is Ultra Instinct and now he is very powerful. To see how it ends go on and watch it here: 
        </p>

        <h3>Goku vs Jesus</h3>
        <p>
          So you see Goku has fought soo many people but this on is special. If your suprised by how they developed this anime and we would love to watch this but it might
          be short, by short I mean very short because no one can defeat this person Goku is about to fight. He is like the un-defeated champion because no one can kill, 
          hurt, or even destory him. He can not be even hurt but it is only once He was dead okay, just to save us. This person even knows that Goku is not bad and together
          with Him, He felt that Goku can do good and help the world. This person loves everyone even the bad ones, He believe that the bad can change and become good like
          how Goku thinks that even the worst can save life.
        </p>

          <h4>Solo-Leveling Season 1 episode 1-2</h4>
           <p>
            Solo-Leveling season 1 episode 1-2 is very normal to be honest and then it is all about the way Jinwoo is an E ranker here and then from 1-2 is very intresting, and will give
            you intense presure and then you want to watch more of it. Sorry I could'nt find the English dub there. Season 1 episode 1-2 is just bloody good and then it is not for people
            under the age of 7 so it is 7+ so for them not to learn blood, fighting and others but if your parents approve of it, it is okay.
